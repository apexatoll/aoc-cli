aoc puzzle init

Description:

  This command can only be run from an event directory (see event init).

  Initialises the given day's puzzle for the current event. This fetches
  the puzzle prompt and input from Advent of Code, creates a puzzle directory,
  and writes the puzzle files to it.

  Once initialised, the new puzzle directory contains two files:
  * Markdown puzzle prompt (format "day_<day>.md")
  * Plain text puzzle input (format "input")

  These files can be restored at any time using puzzle sync.

  The puzzle directory is a good place to write puzzle solution code and review
  previous solution attempts. See puzzle solve and puzzle attempts respectively

Usage:

  aoc puzzle init <day>

  * <day>: Day of puzzle to initialise (1-25).

Examples:

  aoc puzzle init 20 (in an event directory)

  Initializes the day 20 puzzle and creates puzzle directory
