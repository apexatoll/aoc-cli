aoc puzzle sync

Description:

  This command can only be run from a puzzle directory (see puzzle init).

  Restores puzzle dir files (puzzle and input) to their cached state.

  Puzzle data is cached when puzzles are initialised and correctly solved in
  order to decrease load on Advent of Code and increase performance. However
  there may be situations where the cache is outdated: for example if puzzles
  have been solved from the browser.

  To fetch and write the latest puzzle data, pass the --skip-cache flag.

Usage:

  aoc puzzle sync [--skip-cache]

  * <skip-cache>: Whether to ignore puzzle file cache (default false)

Examples:

  aoc puzzle sync (in a puzzle directory)

  Restores (writes or updates) puzzle files to cached state.


  aoc puzzle sync --skip-cache (in a puzzle directory)

  Puzzle data is refreshed before writing the puzzle files.
