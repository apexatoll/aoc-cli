aoc event attach

Description:

  Attaches an existing event to the specified directory (defaults to current
  directory). This may be useful if the original directories have been moved
  or deleted.

  This command cannot be executed from, or target, a directory that is already
  managed by aoc (i.e., existing event and puzzle directories).

  The command will fail if the event has not already been initialized. To
  create a new event, see the event init command.

Usage:

  aoc event attach <year> [--dir=<dir>]

  * <year>: Year of the event to relocate.
  * <dir>: The new event directory (default ".").

Examples:

  aoc event attach 2023 (in a non-AoC directory)

  Relocates the 2023 event directory to the current directory


  aoc event attach 2023 --dir /foo/bar/aoc

  Relocates the 2023 event directory to the specified directory.
