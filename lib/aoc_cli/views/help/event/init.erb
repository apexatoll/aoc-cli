aoc event init

Description:

  Initializes the event for the specified year by fetching event stats and
  creating an event directory in the target directory. The target directory
  defaults to the current directory but can be explicitly specified with the
  optional --dir String argument.

  The event directory serves as the location of event puzzle directories. For
  more information, refer to puzzle init. The name of the created event
  directory defaults to the event year.

  This command cannot be executed from, or target, a directory that is already
  managed by aoc (i.e., existing event and puzzle directories).

  The command will fail if the event has already been initialized elsewhere. To
  move an existing event's location, see the event attach command.

Usage:

  aoc event init <year> [--dir=<dir>]

  * <year>: Year of the event to initialize.
  * <dir>: Base directory to initialize the event within (default ".").

Examples:

  aoc event init 2023 (in a non-AoC directory)

  Initializes the 2023 event and creates the 2023 event directory inside the
  current directory.

  aoc event init 2023 --dir /foo/bar/aoc

  Initializes the 2023 event and creates the 2023 event directory in the
  specified directory.
