## --- Day 23: Crab Cups ---

The small crab challenges _you_ to a game! The crab is going to mix up some cups, and you have to predict where they'll end up.

The cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled _clockwise_ (your puzzle input). For example, if your labeling were `32415`, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup, the cups would be labeled `3`, `2`, `4`, `1`, `5`, and then back to `3` again.

Before the crab starts, it will designate the first cup in your list as the _current cup_. The crab is then going to do _100 moves_.

Each _move_, the crab does the following actions:

- The crab picks up the _three cups_ that are immediately _clockwise_ of the _current cup_. They are removed from the circle; cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.
- The crab selects a _destination cup_: the cup with a _label_ equal to the _current cup's_ label minus one. If this would select one of the cups that was just picked up, the crab will keep subtracting one until it finds a cup that wasn't just picked up. If at any point in this process the value goes below the lowest value on any cup's label, it _wraps around_ to the highest value on any cup's label instead.
- The crab places the cups it just picked up so that they are _immediately clockwise_ of the destination cup. They keep the same order as when they were picked up.
- The crab selects a new _current cup_: the cup which is immediately clockwise of the current cup.

For example, suppose your cup labeling were `389125467`. If the crab were to do merely 10 moves, the following changes would occur:

    -- move 1 --
    cups: (3) 8 9 1 2 5 4 6 7 
    pick up: 8, 9, 1
    destination: 2
    
    -- move 2 --
    cups: 3 (2) 8 9 1 5 4 6 7 
    pick up: 8, 9, 1
    destination: 7
    
    -- move 3 --
    cups: 3 2 (5) 4 6 7 8 9 1 
    pick up: 4, 6, 7
    destination: 3
    
    -- move 4 --
    cups: 7 2 5 (8) 9 1 3 4 6 
    pick up: 9, 1, 3
    destination: 7
    
    -- move 5 --
    cups: 3 2 5 8 (4) 6 7 9 1 
    pick up: 6, 7, 9
    destination: 3
    
    -- move 6 --
    cups: 9 2 5 8 4 (1) 3 6 7 
    pick up: 3, 6, 7
    destination: 9
    
    -- move 7 --
    cups: 7 2 5 8 4 1 (9) 3 6 
    pick up: 3, 6, 7
    destination: 8
    
    -- move 8 --
    cups: 8 3 6 7 4 1 9 (2) 5 
    pick up: 5, 8, 3
    destination: 1
    
    -- move 9 --
    cups: 7 4 1 5 8 3 9 2 (6)
    pick up: 7, 4, 1
    destination: 5
    
    -- move 10 --
    cups: (5) 7 4 1 8 3 9 2 6 
    pick up: 7, 4, 1
    destination: 3
    
    -- final --
    cups: 5 (8) 3 7 4 1 9 2 6

In the above example, the cups' values are the labels as they appear moving clockwise around the circle; the _current cup_ is marked with `( )`.

After the crab is done, what order will the cups be in? Starting _after the cup labeled `1`_, collect the other cups' labels clockwise into a single string with no extra characters; each number except `1` should appear exactly once. In the above example, after 10 moves, the cups clockwise from `1` are labeled `9`, `2`, `6`, `5`, and so on, producing _`92658374`_. If the crab were to complete all 100 moves, the order after cup `1` would be _`67384529`_.

Using your labeling, simulate 100 moves. _What are the labels on the cups after cup `1`?_
